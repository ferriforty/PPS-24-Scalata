 * <li>For every <i>alive</i> enemy in the room:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Compute the four-tile neighbourhood around the enemy
 * (<code>neighboursFiltered</code>).</li>
 * <li>If the playerâ€™s position lies in that neighbourhood,
 * apply <code>enemy.attack(player)</code>.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * <li>Return the player after all damage has been accumulated
 * (purely functional fold).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The method is <b>pure</b>: it produces a new <code>Player</code> instance
 * without mutating the session or the room.
