## Overview

**Scalata** is a text-based video game inspired by the classic *Rogue*, falling within the **roguelike** genre. The player's goal is to climb an infinite tower, facing enemies and collecting useful items to survive and continue the ascent.

Each level of the tower is **procedurally generated**, composed of a series of rooms. In these rooms, the player may:

- Encounter monsters
- Find items and equipment
- Discover a staircase in the final room of each level to ascend further

As the player progresses:

- **Difficulty increases**
- **Enemies become more numerous**
- **Useful items grow rarer and more valuable**
